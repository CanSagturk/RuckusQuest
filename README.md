# Running the Game

## What's this game

It's a short platformer game called Ruckus Quest. It is comprised of 5 levels, and they should be beatable in around 5 to 10 minutes. Even though it is fun to play, this game is more of a demo.

## How to Setup and Play

You only need to download this repository as is and run "Ruckus Quest.exe". Don't separate the contents of the root folder, since otherwise it won't run properly.
